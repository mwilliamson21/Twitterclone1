What we're going to do is build a small clone of Twitter. It will feature logged in users, a customized homepage, a tweet composing page, the ability to follow other users, and more. We'll be using every single concept from the recipe application plus a few more; don't worry though, we've got plenty of time.

Part 1 is all about the folder structure. Part 2 is going to be implementing the logic and front end, and there's lots of resources available to help. 

There will be four pieces to this application, each with their own subfolder:

twitterclone
twitterusers
tweets
authentication
notifications
Each subfolder will (potentially) need its own:

models.py
views.py
urls.py
forms.py
__init__.py
Set up the initial folder structure and create all the files you'll need -- get the settings.py file configured and the django server ready to go. In Part 2, we'll start filling in the files with logic.
